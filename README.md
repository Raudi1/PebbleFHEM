PebbleFHEM
==========

A simple Pebble APP to control RGB light strips through FHEM. Can also easily be changed to perform other FHEM actions.

Features:
Perform a FHEM command by pressing or long pressing a button on your Pebble. I use it to turn on/off, dim and change the color of a RGB LED strip.

Can easily be changed to execute any number of other commands. Just import it to cloudpebble.

Looks ugly and IP,port,commands etc. have to be hard coded right now. So please feel free to fork it and add settings. Since it works for me as I need it right now, I will not do it for now. Perhaps later.

This is my first time writing a Pebble APP and using JavaScript and I only spent 1 or 2 hours on it, so please feel free to improve this APP.
